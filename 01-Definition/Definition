#PROBLEM
-The growing demand for online learning has led many people to seek accessible platforms 
for a wide range of courses. However, users often find limitations with current options, 
such as complicated navigation, limited payment methods, or unclear access to study materials. 
The lack of a streamlined system that allows users to efficiently find, access, 
and purchase courses negatively impacts customer satisfaction and limits online learning opportunities.
This project aims to develop a website that allows users to register, securely purchase courses, 
and access educational materials. The system should facilitate access to materials,
handle secure payments (including online and transfer options), and allow the administrator to comprehensively
manage courses and users.


##OVERVIEW 

he platform will focus on selling online and hybrid courses, 
offering users a simplified browsing and purchasing experience. 
Once registered, users can purchase courses in various subjects, 
view acquired content in their accounts, and access materials like videos and supporting documents.
The system will allow the administrator to manage courses, create roles, and monitor payments and sales. 
This project aims to provide an effective, user-friendly solution that enhances the experience of acquiring
knowledge online, increasing accessibility and providing a controlled, managed environment.

##BACKGROUND
With the growth of online education, more and more people seek digital learning options.
However, many existing websites fail to fully meet user needs, whether in terms of quick access to content,
easy payments, or adequate support. Implementing a functional course sales platform aims to improve the user 
experience by offering a straightforward structure adapted to diverse needs.An automated course sales system 
can improve course management, ensuring users receive what they need quickly and effectively, 
and that the administrator can efficiently manage content, payments, and user access. 
It will also include options for generating sales reports and allowing future expansions to the course catalog.
