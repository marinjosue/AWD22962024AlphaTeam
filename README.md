# PROJECT TITLE

## Description
The car parts store is facing some real challenges keeping track of all the parts it sells. With so many different items and customer needs constantly changing, it’s tough to stay on top of which parts are in stock and which ones are running low. Right now, they’re managing everything by hand, which has led to problems like running out of popular parts or, sometimes, ending up with way too much of something. This has frustrated customers and made the team’s work a lot harder.
To solve this, the store wants to create a new system that makes it easy to track their inventory. This app will show what’s in stock at any time, give alerts when something needs to be restocked, and highlight products that aren’t selling as much so they can avoid over-ordering. The app will also generate reports on sales and help predict future demand, giving the store useful insights to make smarter decisions about what to stock. With this new system, the store aims to keep customers happy, cut down on wasted inventory, and make operations run more smoothly.
